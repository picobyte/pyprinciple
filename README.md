# pyprinciple
Python layer for Il_principle

## Dependencies
* PyQt5
* Qt Charts

## Directory structure
Currently, the code expects the following directory structure:

* ProjectDirectory/  _(any name is fine)_
    * interpreter/  _(contains the compiled, platform-dependent python runtime)_
    * pythonsrc/  _(a clone of the master branch of the pyprinciple repository)_
        * widgets/  _(a clone of the master branch of my commonwidgets repository)_
    * Schools/  _(a copy of the HHS game ressources; contains e.g. the NormalSchool directory)_

Please note that you need a clone of my "commonwidgets" repository inside the pythonsrc directory.
