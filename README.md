# pyprinciple
Python layer for Il_principle

## Dependencies
* PyQt5
* Qt Charts

## Directory structure
Currently, the code expects the following directory structure:

* ProjectDirectory/  (any name is fine)
    * interpreter/  (contains the compiled, platform-dependent python runtime)
    * pythonsrc/  (a clone of the master branch of the pyprinciple repository)
        * widgets/  (a clone of the master branch of my commonwidgets repository)
    * Schools/  (a copy of the HHS game ressources; contains e.g. the NormalSchool directory)

Please note that you need a clone of my "commonwidgets" repository inside the pythonsrc directory.
